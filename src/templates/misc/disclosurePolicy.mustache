                                        This policy is addressed to security researchers interested in reporting security vulnerabilities to MailTag (hereby collectively referred to as “THE MAILTAG COMPANY”), and must be read in the context of the MailTag Terms of Use and Purchase.
                                    </p>

                                        If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability on a MailTag property or application, we strongly encourage you to inform us as quickly as possible and to not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it is fixed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We appreciate your assistance, and we review all reports and will do our best to address the issue in a timely fashion. To encourage responsible disclosure, MailTag will not bring a lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you if we determine that a disclosure meets the following guidelines.
                                    </p>

                                        Notify MailTag and provide us details of the vulnerability. Please provide us a reasonable time period to address the issue before public disclosure. Provide an appropriate level of detail on the vulnerability to allow us to identify and reproduce the issue. Detail should include target URLs, request/response pairs, screenshots, and/or other information. We will confirm your email and evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the issue. For valid issues, we will work to fix the issue and keep you appraised of progress. Make a reasonable effort to avoid service disruption (e.g. DoS), privacy issues (i.e. accessing a MailTag user’s data), and data destruction when performing vulnerability research. Do not request compensation for security vulnerability reports either from MailTag or external vulnerability marketplaces. Do not phish or social engineer employees, partners, or users of MailTag. Do not run automated scanning tools and send us the output without confirming the issue is present. Security tools often output false positives that should be confirmed by the reporter.
