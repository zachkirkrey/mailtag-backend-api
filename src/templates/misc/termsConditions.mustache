Some User Submissions are viewable by other users, for example, anything you send to your recipients via email will be viewable by them. In addition, User Submissions are viewable when you share a Sequence or Template, share an email via a share link, and when you enable people in your organization to view your messages in the Live Feed. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.

This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.

Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.

In addition, User Submission that are sent to other users (such as emails or email attachments) may be retained by the recipient users.

                                        This Agreement is entered into in Arizona and shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Arizona without reference to Arizona choice of law principles. Only the Arizona Maricopa courts (state and federal) shall have jurisdiction over controversies regarding this Agreement, and any proceeding involving such a controversy shall be brought only in those courts, in Maricopa County, and not elsewhere. Any process in such proceeding may be served by, among other methods, delivering it or mailing it, by registered or certified mail, directed to a Party. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MAILTAG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and MailTag agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and MailTag, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of MailTag, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind MailTag in any respect whatsoever.
