                                    We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google account to your new MailTag account (using Google’s OAuth authentication method), thereby providing us with access to your Google account, including but not limited to email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the OAuth authentication provides broad access to your Google account, MailTag accesses and stores a subset of data from your Google account, including name, email address, calendar content, contacts, and company domain directory, to provide you with our Services. During email composition, we temporarily store the content of your draft email message (however once the message is sent, draft content is transferred to your Gmail account and stored on Google’s servers, not MailTag’s). MailTag stores the email body in the following contexts: when you create an email draft and the message remains unsent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can limit the amount of Personal Information transferred to us by being sure to complete and send your draft email messages, or by deleting any unsent drafts if you decide not to send them, or by refraining from using the features listed above in which we store the email body, or other features in which we notify you that we store the email body.
                                </p>

                                    When you send email using the Services we collect the recipient’s name, email address and the email subject line so that we can display that information in your MailTag dashboard and for debugging purposes. If you are using open, click, and download tracking, MailTag collects the recipient’s device type, device ID and IP address, along with the recipient’s activities (for example: opens, clicks, downloads).

                                    Alternatively, you can also limit all Personal Information transferred to us by disabling the MailTag extension entirely in your browser’s “Extensions” section (accessible by typing “chrome://extensions” into your Chrome browser URL and hitting the “Enter” key) and then restarting your browser.

Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.
